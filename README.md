## Dockerizing the Application

### 1. Build the Docker image

```
docker build -t myapp .
```

### 2. Run the Docker container

```
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 myapp
```

- Replace `3000:3000` with the appropriate port if your app uses a different one.
- Edit the `Dockerfile` to install your app's dependencies and set the correct start command.

### 3. Access your application

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you exposed).

---

**Note:**
- Make sure to update the `Dockerfile` with your app's specific dependencies and start command.
- If you use environment variables, you can pass them with `-e VAR=value` in the `docker run` command.
